abstract = {Abstract:
Natural antibody classes in humans include IgA (two isotypes), IgD, IgE, IgG (four isotypes), and IgM (two major forms, pentameric and hexameric). Of these, all current marketed MAbs and Fc fusion proteins are of the IgG classes. Human IgG1 and to a lesser degree human IgG2 and IgG4, have been used as scaffolds for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Antibodies of the human IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes bind all Fcγ receptors (FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb), whereas IgG4 binds primarily FcγRI and very weakly to the other FcγRs, and IgG2 binds primarily FcγRIIa. These different binding characteristics give these isotypes very different immune-mediated activities, which have been used to help optimize antibody activity. Some efforts have been made to use IgM and IgA scaffolds for therapeutic MAbs, although none of these have yet reached the market.}

Their utility has been harnessed as they have been and continue to be used extensively as a diagnostic and research reagent. They are also becoming an important therapeutic tool in the clinician's armamentarium to treat disease. Antibodies are utilized for analysis, purification, and enrichment, and to mediate or modulate physiological responses. This overview of the structure and function of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies describes features that distinguish one from the other. A limited review of their use as specific research, diagnostic, and therapeutic reagents and a list of printed and electronic resources that can be utilized to garner additional information on these topics are also included.}",
